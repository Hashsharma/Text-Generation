Great! If you already have a `requirements.txt` file, you can include it in the `README.md` to make it easier for others to set up the project. Here's an updated version of the `README.md` file with instructions on how to use the `requirements.txt` file.

```markdown
# Document Question Answering with Transformers

This project utilizes Hugging Face's `transformers` library to perform document-based question answering using a pre-trained model. The goal is to answer user-provided questions from a document image (PNG format) by leveraging Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## Requirements

To install the necessary dependencies, use the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure your Python version is 3.6 or higher.

## Usage

1. **Set up the model path**:
    - Ensure you have the model stored locally. Replace the `model_path` variable with the correct path to your locally saved model.

2. **Run the script**:
    - The script loads the model and uses it to answer questions based on the document image provided. The code expects a PNG image (e.g., `Screenshot 2025-02-25 201713.png` in the example).

3. **Answer a question**:
    - The script accepts a question as a string (e.g., `"What is dot?"`) and provides an answer extracted from the document.

## Example Code

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pre-trained model for document-based question answering
model_path = "../../models/"
nlp = pipeline(
    "document-question-answering",
    model=model_path,
)

# Provide the document and the question
ans = nlp(
    "../resource/Screenshot 2025-02-25 201713.png",
    "What is dot?"
)

# Print the answer
print(ans)
```

In the above code:
- `model_path` is the location of your locally saved model. Other wise download it from https://huggingface.co/impira/layoutlm-document-qa/tree/main pytorch_model.bin
- The question `"What is dot?"` is asked about the document image located at `"../resource/Screenshot 2025-02-25 201713.png"`.

## Notes
- Replace the paths in the code with your own file paths for the model and image.
- The model you use should be capable of document-based question answering.
- The image should contain text that the model can process for answering questions.
